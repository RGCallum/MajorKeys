Major Keys Overview
For project #1, I created a variation on the hangman game and hip hop trivia games.
When a player visits the site, they hear the Major Keys theme music, then clicks on start or Rules. 
The object of the game is to get 3 keys from DJ Khaled by typing the correct word in the input box. First 3 words correct wins the game and the first 3 words incorrect, the player will lose the game. Best 3 out of 5 wins. If player answers 1st question incorrect, player loses. Each word is worth 1000 points and 1 key, and player must maintain a score above 0 in order to continue game.
