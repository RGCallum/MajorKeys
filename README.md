# MajorKeys

Major Keys Overview
For project #1, I created a variation on the hangman game and hip hop trivia games.
When a player visits the site, they hear the Major Keys theme music, then clicks on start or Rules. 
The object of the game is to get 3 keys from DJ Khaled by typing the correct word in the input box. If the word is incorrect you get no key, but you will have another chance to answer the question. 3 incorrect questions results in Game Over! First 3 words correct wins the game and the first 3 words incorrect, the player will lose the game. Best 3 out of 5 wins. If player answers 1st question incorrect, player loses. Each word is worth 1000 points and 1 key, and player must maintain a score above 0 in order to continue game. 

I did a lot of editing in Photoshop to create and color characters, edit background photo and edit downloaded gifs as well as final cut pro to edit audio. The Dj khaled gif alone was time consuming as it came with a white background that I had to delete the background for 21 images and then re-export as a gif. My Javascript is pretty simple with if/else statements and set interval to create the illusion of the character running towards DJ Khaled for a correct answer. I'm really proud of my Javascript as I came up with it on my own. I know my Javascript can be even more dry with a for loop, however I was having a little trouble with my arrays, so I switched to what I know, a long a$$ if/else statement! lol. Making this game was awesome, and allowed me to challenge myself. Enjoy the game!!
